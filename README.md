# IURWDD

Description: The considerable variety of indoor and outdoor waste materials scenarios was meticulously captured in our data collection  and annotation methods. The majority of the thrash scene photographs were taken in West Bengal, India, in both urban and natural settings such as streets, parks, and lawns. We purposefully carried out this work in inclement weather, such as rain, and sunshine, as well as various daylight conditions, like morning, evening, and night. 6000 high-resolution photos with manually annotated ground truth for waste segmentation are included in the collection. The data was annotated using the LabelImg[1] program in both Pascal VOC and YOLO formats. The Dataset contains 21 classes such as Plastic carry, paper, paper_cup, plastic, plastic_coantainer, paper_cardboard, cigarette_packet, plastic_bottle, newspaper, thermocol, match_Box, metal, cloth, plastic_sack, medicine_wrapper, glass_bottle, glass, nylon, cotton, aluminium_foil and  rubber with total 15884 Instances.
